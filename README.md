## Unrealistic MVP

First Round MVP features include:

- Threads under RP categories will have tabs for IC, and OOC.
- Private Messages
- User profiles and post histories
- BBCode

Second Round MVP Features include:
- Image uploading
- Thread moderation tools for GMs of RPs.
- Ability to add up to any number of co-GMs to an RP.
- Ability for GMs and co-GMs to specify if their RP requires more than one thread. If this is toggled, the thread should become what basically amounts to a sub-forum that then allows the GMs to create up to 5 threads for their roleplay.

- Character tagging/User Mentions in posts
- Character pages that can be independently styled.
- Account Switching so that you can switch to a character's account if you made one for them. This includes being able to edit a post and change the author to another one of your accounts.
- Character Pages will include a list of RPs they are connected to as well as independent posting histories.

Fourth Round MVP Features Include:
- Visitor Messages on Profiles
- Status Bar - General
- A status system for RP threads that GMs can utilize, which would basically send realtime notifications to players/characters associated with that RP and would be visible at the top of any thread associated with that RP--if they're a multi-thread RP.

Fifth Round MVP Features Include:
- Ability for Forum admins to create their own styles for the forum, or to select a default template.
- Ability for Users to select a template that is not the default for their own view of the forum.
- Thread tags, and filtering.
